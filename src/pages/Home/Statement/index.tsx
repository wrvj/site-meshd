          3d techniques have been used in the design proccess of products of all
          kinds for decades, and it continues to be a powerful tool for that.
          But over the last few years, 3d has grown to be much more than a mean
          of prototyping physical goods. The world is quickly becoming more
          virtual, and so should your business. Meshd can be your partner,
          providing you our your company taylor-made 3d solutions, from
          traditional ones like product and architeture rendering, to 3d for
          virtual (VR) and augmented (VR) reality, games, animations, and even
          for future, uncharted applications, like the metaverse.
