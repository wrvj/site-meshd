        <p>
          3D techniques have been used in the design process of products of all
          kinds for decades, and it continues to be a powerful tool for that.
          But over the last few years, 3D has grown to be much more than a mean
          of prototyping physical goods. The world is quickly becoming more
          virtual, and so should your business. Meshd can be your partner,
          providing you and your company tailor-made 3D solutions, from
          traditional ones like product and architecture rendering, to 3D for
          virtual (VR) and augmented (VR) reality, games, animations, and even
          for future: the metaverse.
